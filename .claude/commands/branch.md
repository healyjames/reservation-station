# Create Feature Branch from Jira Ticket

Create a feature branch named after a Jira ticket, ensuring a clean state on latest main.

## Arguments

$ARGUMENTS — Required: Jira ticket ID (e.g., `NG20-1234`)

If no ticket ID is provided, ask the user for one and stop.

## Step 1: Validate Ticket ID

Check that `$ARGUMENTS` matches a Jira ticket pattern (e.g., `NG20-1234`, `BOARD-123`). If not, ask the user:

```
Please provide a valid Jira ticket ID (e.g., NG20-1234)
```

## Step 2: Check for Uncommitted Changes

```bash
git status --porcelain
```

**If there are uncommitted changes:**

```
You have uncommitted changes. Please commit, stash, or discard them before creating a new branch.
```

**STOP and wait for user to resolve.**

## Step 3: Ensure We're on Main

```bash
git branch --show-current
```

**If not on main:**

```
Currently on branch '<branch-name>'. I need to switch to main to create the new branch.
Switch to main? (y/n)
```

**STOP and wait for confirmation.** If the user declines, stop entirely.

If confirmed:

```bash
git checkout main
```

## Step 4: Get Latest Main

```bash
git pull origin main
```

If pull fails, inform the user and stop.

## Step 5: Fetch Jira Ticket

Fetch the ticket to get its title. Use the same credential setup as `/jira`:

1. Read credentials from `~/AI/config/jira.env`
2. If credentials don't exist, tell the user to run `/jira` first to set up credentials, then stop

```bash
source ~/AI/config/jira.env && curl -s \
  -H "Authorization: Basic $(echo -n "$JIRA_EMAIL:$JIRA_API_TOKEN" | base64)" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  "$JIRA_BASE_URL/rest/api/3/issue/<TICKET-ID>?fields=summary"
```

Extract the ticket summary from the response.

If the API call fails (401, 404, etc.), fall back to asking the user for a branch name:

```
Couldn't fetch ticket details. What should the branch be called?
(I'll prefix it with <TICKET-ID>-)
```

## Step 6: Generate Branch Name

Build the branch name from the ticket:

1. Take the ticket ID (uppercase as-is, e.g., `NG20-1234`)
2. Take the ticket summary and convert to kebab-case: lowercase, replace spaces/special chars with hyphens, remove consecutive hyphens
3. Combine: `<TICKET-ID>-<kebab-summary>`
4. Truncate to 60 characters max (don't cut mid-word)

Present to user:

```
Branch name: <generated-name>
Create this branch? (y, or type a different name)
```

**STOP and wait for confirmation or alternative.**

## Step 7: Create and Checkout Branch

```bash
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

## Step 8: Confirm

```
Branch '<branch-name>' created from latest main.
You're ready to start work.
```

## Rules

- NEVER create a branch with uncommitted changes
- NEVER switch branches without user confirmation
- Always pull latest main before branching
- Always confirm the branch name with the user before creating
