# Check Pull Request

Check that all everything has been commited and is ready for a pull request

## Step 1: Check Security Audit Status

Check if `/security` has been run for this plan:

- Look for security audit results in conversation history
- If not run, remind user:

```
Security audit not run. Consider running /security first.
Note this is not neccisary for every PR, so use discretion
Continue with PR anyway? (y/n)
```

If user declines, stop and let them run `/security`.

## Step 2: Verify Plan Complete

Find the current active plan and verify all subtasks are complete or marked as to do in another PR:

1. Read `.claude/temp/*/plan.md` for active plan
2. Check all subtasks have `- [x] Dev`, `- [x] Review`, `- [x] Present` checked

If incomplete:

```
Plan is not complete.

Remaining subtasks:
- Subtask <N>: <title> (needs: Dev, Review, Present)
- Subtask <M>: <title> (needs: Present)

Run /next to continue.
```

## Step 3: Verify Branch State

```bash
git status
git log main..HEAD --oneline
```

Ensure:

- No uncommitted changes
- Branch has commits ahead of main
- All planned commits are present

If uncommitted changes:

```
Warning: Uncommitted changes detected.
Commit or stash before opening PR? (y/n)
```

## Step 5: Generate PR Description

Build the PR description using this structure. The description must start with the ticket context (what problem we're solving) before listing the changes.

**Template:**

```markdown
## Ticket

<TICKET-ID>: <ticket title or one-line problem statement>
<Jira URL if available, otherwise omit>

## Problem

<1-3 sentences explaining what was wrong or what needed to change and why>

## Changes

<Bulleted list of what was actually changed>

## Test plan

<Bulleted checklist of how to verify the changes>
```

**Where to get the information:**

- **Ticket ID**: from plan metadata or branch name
- **Problem**: from research.md or task description — what was the user trying to solve?
- **Changes**: from git diff and plan subtasks
- **Test plan**: from test cases written and manual verification steps

## Step 6: Present for Approval

```markdown
## Pull Request Preview

**Title:** <TICKET-ID>: <short description>

**Description:**
<generated description using template above>

---

**Approve?** (y/go, or provide feedback)
```

**STOP and wait for user approval.**

If user provides feedback:

- Adjust title/description
- Present again

## Step 7: Create PR

After approval, open the PR in the browser so the user can make final edits before submitting:

```bash
gh pr create --base main --title "<title>" --body "<description>" --web
```

**IMPORTANT:** Always use the `--web` flag. This opens the PR creation page in the browser rather than submitting it directly. The user will review and make final edits before clicking "Create pull request" in GitHub. Do NOT create the PR without `--web`.

## Step 8: Update Plan and Status

Update plan.md:

- Set Status to `COMPLETE`
- Add PR link if desired

Update `status.md` in the same task directory:

- Set `work_status` to `merged`
- Set `merged_date` to today's date
- Add the PR URL as a new line: `- pr_url: <url>`

## Step 9: Report

```
PR created: <url>

Plan '<plan-name>' is now complete.
```

## Rules

- NEVER create PR with incomplete commits
- NEVER create PR without user approval of title/description
- Always ask user to push branch before creating PR
- Use pr-description agent for consistent formatting
