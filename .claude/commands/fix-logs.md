# Fix Logs

Audit and fix all logging in a service to comply with `docs/logging-strategy.md`.

## Arguments

$ARGUMENTS — the service name to audit (e.g. `content-service`, `search-service`, `product-service`, `portal-service`, `lead-service`, `sales-service`)

## Step 1: Read the strategy

Read `docs/logging-strategy.md` to understand the rules.

## Step 2: Audit the service

Search all `.ts` files in `apps/services/<service-name>/src/` for logging statements (`logger.info`, `logger.error`, `logger.warn`, `logger.debug`, `createLogger`).

For each log statement, check:

1. **Logger naming**: Does it follow `{service-name}:{module-name}` format?
2. **Core dimensions**: Does it include `productId`, `entityType`, `brand` where applicable?
3. **Pipeline dimension**: Does it include `pipeline`?
4. **Log level**: Is it appropriate (boundary = INFO, internal = DEBUG, failure = ERROR)?
5. **Business logic decisions**: If code changes a product's outcome (e.g. unpublish instead of publish), is the decision logged with a `reason`?
6. **Early validation errors**: Do they include as much context as possible?

## Step 3: Create a plan

Write a plan to `.claude/temp/<service-name>-logging-fix-plan.md` with:

- A table of every log that needs changing, with file path, line number, current state, and what needs to change
- Grouped by file
- Priority: missing core dimensions first, then pipeline, then level corrections

Present this plan to the user for approval before making changes.

## Step 4: Fix

After approval, implement the fixes:

1. Add `logContext` objects at the top of handlers where missing
2. Add `pipeline` dimension to all log contexts
3. Ensure `productId`, `entityType`, `brand` are spread into every log in product-processing code
4. Fix logger names that don't follow the convention
5. Add `reason` to business logic decision logs that are missing it
6. Adjust log levels where incorrect

## Step 5: Verify

```bash
npx nx test <service-name>
npm run lint
npm run format:check
```

Fix any failures. Log changes should not break tests (we don't test logging calls per our testing guidelines).

## Rules

- Do NOT add new logs that don't exist — only fix existing ones
- Do NOT remove logs — only improve their dimensions and levels
- Do NOT change log messages unless the message is misleading
- If a handler doesn't have a `logContext` pattern, introduce one at the top and spread it
- If `brand` isn't available in a handler (e.g. it's not in the message schema), don't fabricate it — note it in the plan as a gap
