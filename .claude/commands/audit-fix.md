# Audit Fix

Take one dimension file produced by `/audit` and implement its fixes, grouping the work into a single PR or multiple PRs at your discretion.

## Arguments

$ARGUMENTS — `<target> <dimension>` and an optional `<date>`.

- `<target>` — the audited target (this project has a single target: `reservation-station`).
- `<dimension>` — the file slug (e.g. `dead-code`, `potential-bugs`, `type-safety`).
- `<date>` — optional `YYYY-MM-DD`. If omitted, use the **most recent** `.claude/audit/<date>/` folder that contains this file.

## Step 1: Load the audit file

Read `.claude/audit/<date>/<target>/<dimension>.md`. If it doesn't exist, list what audit files DO exist for that target and stop.

Parse every issue with its ID (`H1`, `M2`, …), location, fix, and effort.

## Step 2: Propose a fix plan (get approval first)

Do NOT touch code yet. Decide grouping:

- **Single PR** — the default when the fixes are cohesive and small/medium in total.
- **Multiple PRs** — when there are many High issues, or the fixes are logically separable (e.g. split risky behavioural fixes from safe dead-code deletion), or the diff would be too large to review well. Use your judgement.

Present the plan (PR groups with issue IDs, and anything excluded with a reason). **STOP and wait for approval.** The user may re-group, drop issues, or approve.

## Step 3: Implement, one PR group at a time

For each approved group, in order:

1. Create a branch off `main` (naming: `audit/<dimension>-<n>`).
2. Implement the fixes for that group exactly as described. If a fix is wrong or unsafe on inspection, stop and flag it rather than guessing.
3. Add/adjust tests per `docs/testing.md` — behaviour, not implementation detail.
4. Run `npm run test`, `npm run build`, and `npx prettier --check .` and fix failures.
5. Present the group's changes (files, tests, what each issue ID resolved). **Do not commit or push.**

## Step 4: Hand off

After each group is implemented and green, report which issue IDs were resolved and the branch name, then tell the user to commit and run `/pr`. Continue to the next group only after the user confirms.

## Step 5: Mark progress in the audit file

As issues are resolved, prefix the resolved issue heading with `[FIXED]` (e.g. `### [H1] [FIXED] ...`) so re-runs are idempotent. Do not delete issues.

## Rules

- Never commit or push — the user does.
- Implement only what's in the audit file (plus the tests those fixes need). No drive-by changes.
- If a fix turns out to be wrong or needs a product decision, skip it and report — don't force it.
- Keep each PR group independently reviewable and green before moving on.
- If shared schema/enum values change (`src/schema/index.ts`), update `db/schema.sql`, the migration, and `documentation/DATA_MODEL.md` in the same group.
