# Planning Phase

## Prerequisites

Requires existing research.md. If not found:

```
No research.md found.
Run /research first, or /begin for full workflow.
```

## Instructions

Find the current task directory (using our task <slug>, or the most recent folder in .claude/temp/ with research.md but no plan.md).
If a plan.md already exists, check it is correct for the task description and then run /resume. If it is not complete or not correct, ask the user to manually review.
If no plan exists, run the `planner` agent to create the implementation plan:

- Input: research.md + task description + existing plan if it exists
- Output: `.claude/temp/<slug>/plan.md`

## What the Planner Does

1. Reads research.md to understand context
2. Breaks work into subtasks (small, committable steps)
3. Defines goals and files for each subtask
4. Creates trackable checklists
5. At any point where there are unknowns or clarifications needed, pause to prompt the user for more information

## Testing

For large tasks, add unit-test subtasks where appropriate, as their own subtasks.
For small tasks, add a final unit-test subtask to add unit tests at the end.

## Verify the plan

For non-trivial tasks, apply the **`verify-plan` skill** before signoff: critique the plan against
research and the acceptance criteria and fix gaps. If there are **no** acceptance criteria yet, draft
a testable set and confirm them with the user, and record them in plan.md.

## After Planning

After the plan is verified, automatically run /signoff to present the research and plan for user
approval. Do not ask the user to run /signoff manually.

## Rules

- Use the planner agent - don't create plan manually
- Research must exist first
- Each subtask should be small and committable
- Claude should NEVER commit without explicit user permission
- After completing a subtask, suggest a commit message and wait for user to commit
- If the approach is genuinely ambiguous or decisions are needed, apply the `clarify` skill rather than guessing
- For non-trivial work, apply the `slicing` skill to decide whether it's one PR or a stack; record slices in plan.md
- Always check for a plan first and carry on from wherever we stopped work last
- Always track the work we have done in the plan so we can stop and start work as needed
- Stop and prompt the user rather than making assumptions on unknowns or areas of clarification
- If the task touches the data model (`Tenant`, `Reservation`, `AdminUser`, `BlockedDate`, `OpeningHours`), the plan must include updating `db/schema.sql`, the relevant migration, `src/schema/index.ts`, and `documentation/DATA_MODEL.md` together (per CLAUDE.md's Data First rule)
