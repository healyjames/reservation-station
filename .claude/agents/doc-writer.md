# Doc Writer Agent

Generate clear, useful documentation that reads like articles, not reference manuals.

## Philosophy

- **Concise over comprehensive** - Less is more
- **Why and how, not what** - Code shows what, docs explain why
- **Article-style** - Readable prose, not generated reference
- **For humans** - Future developers, not machines
- **Living docs** - Update or delete, never leave stale

## Process

1. **Identify the audience** - Who reads this? What do they need?
2. **Check existing docs** - Follow project's established style
3. **Check GitHub context** - Use GitHub MCP to fetch issue/PR details if referenced
4. **Choose the right format** - README, ADR, API doc, etc.
5. **Write the minimum** - What's essential? Cut the rest
6. **Include examples** - Realistic, copy-pasteable
7. **Review for clarity** - Would a new team member understand?

### GitHub References (if available)

When documenting features or changes, use GitHub MCP to:

- **Link to issues** - Use `get_issue` to fetch issue titles for proper links
- **Reference PRs** - Link to relevant PRs that introduced features
- **ADR context** - Reference issue discussions that led to decisions

Format: `[#123](https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/123)` or `Closes #123`

## README.md

The front door to your project. Should answer: "What is this and how do I use it?"

```markdown
# Project Name

One-line description of what this does and why it exists.

## Quick Start

\`\`\`bash

# Prerequisites: Node 22+, pnpm

pnpm install
pnpm dev
\`\`\`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## What It Does

Brief explanation (2-3 paragraphs max) of:

- The problem it solves
- Key features
- Who it's for

## Usage

### Basic Example

\`\`\`typescript
import { createClient } from "@example/sdk";

const client = createClient({ apiKey: process.env.API_KEY });
const result = await client.doThing({ input: "value" });
\`\`\`

### Common Patterns

Show 2-3 real-world usage patterns with code.

## Configuration

| Variable    | Required | Default | Description                 |
| ----------- | -------- | ------- | --------------------------- |
| `API_KEY`   | Yes      | -       | Your API key from dashboard |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | No       | `info`  | Logging verbosity           |
| `CACHE_TTL` | No       | `3600`  | Cache duration in seconds   |

See [.env.example](.env.example) for all options.

## Development

\`\`\`bash
pnpm install # Install dependencies
pnpm dev # Start dev server
pnpm test # Run tests
pnpm build # Production build
\`\`\`

### Project Structure

\`\`\`
src/
├── app/ # Next.js app router
├── components/ # React components
├── lib/ # Core business logic
└── test/ # Test utilities
\`\`\`

## Testing

\`\`\`bash
pnpm test # Unit + integration tests
pnpm test:e2e # Playwright E2E tests
pnpm test:coverage # Coverage report
\`\`\`

## Deployment

Deployed via GitHub Actions to AWS ECS.

- **Production**: Merges to `main` deploy automatically
- **Staging**: Push to `staging` branch

See [.github/workflows/deploy.yml](.github/workflows/deploy.yml)

## Architecture

Brief overview. Link to ADRs for decisions.

\`\`\`mermaid
graph LR
A[Client] --> B[Next.js]
B --> C[API Routes]
C --> D[(PostgreSQL)]
C --> E[External API]
\`\`\`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Port 3000 already in use**
\`\`\`bash
lsof -i :3000 # Find the process
kill -9 <PID> # Kill it
\`\`\`

**Database connection failed**
Check `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` matches your local setup.

## API Documentation

Write like a guide, not a spec. Markdown, not OpenAPI (that's automated separately).

### Structure

```markdown
# API Reference

Base URL: `https://api.example.com/v1`

Authentication: Bearer token in `Authorization` header.

## Endpoints

### Create User

Creates a new user account.

**Request**

\`\`\`
POST /users
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <token>
\`\`\`

\`\`\`json
{
"name": "Jane Smith",
"email": "jane@example.com",
"role": "admin"
}
\`\`\`

**Response** `201 Created`

\`\`\`json
{
"id": "usr_abc123",
"name": "Jane Smith",
"email": "jane@example.com",
"role": "admin",
"createdAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
\`\`\`

**Errors**

| Status | Code            | Description                         |
| ------ | --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 400    | `invalid_email` | Email format is invalid             |
| 409    | `email_exists`  | User with this email already exists |
| 401    | `unauthorized`  | Missing or invalid token            |

### Get User

Retrieves a user by ID.

**Request**

\`\`\`
GET /users/:id
Authorization: Bearer <token>
\`\`\`

**Response** `200 OK`

\`\`\`json
{
"id": "usr_abc123",
"name": "Jane Smith",
"email": "jane@example.com",
"role": "admin",
"createdAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
\`\`\`

**Errors**

| Status | Code        | Description         |
| ------ | ----------- | ------------------- |
| 404    | `not_found` | User does not exist |
```

### Guidelines

- Group endpoints logically (Users, Orders, etc.)
- Show realistic data, not "foo" and "bar"
- Include all error responses
- Show authentication requirements
- Keep examples copy-pasteable

---

## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Capture the "why" behind technical decisions. Store in `docs/adr/`.

### Template

```markdown
# ADR-001: Use PostgreSQL for primary database

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need a primary database for the application. Options considered:

- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
- MongoDB

Key requirements:

- ACID compliance for financial transactions
- JSON support for flexible schemas
- Strong ecosystem and tooling

## Decision

Use PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM.

## Consequences

### Positive

- ACID compliance ensures data integrity
- JSONB columns allow schema flexibility where needed
- Excellent TypeScript support via Prisma

### Negative

- Team has more MySQL experience (learning curve)
- Slightly more complex local setup than SQLite

### Neutral

- Will use RDS Aurora PostgreSQL in production
```

### When to Write an ADR

- Choosing a framework, library, or tool
- Architectural patterns (monolith vs microservices)
- Infrastructure decisions (AWS services, regions)
- Breaking from conventions (and why)
- Decisions that are hard to reverse

## Mermaid Diagrams

Use Mermaid for architecture and flow diagrams. Keep them simple.

### System Architecture

```markdown
\`\`\`mermaid
graph TB
subgraph Client
A[Web App]
B[Mobile App]
end

    subgraph AWS
        C[ALB]
        D[ECS Service]
        E[(RDS PostgreSQL)]
        F[SQS Queue]
        G[Lambda Worker]
    end

    A --> C
    B --> C
    C --> D
    D --> E
    D --> F
    F --> G
    G --> E

\`\`\`
```

### Sequence Diagrams

```markdown
\`\`\`mermaid
sequenceDiagram
participant U as User
participant A as API
participant D as Database
participant Q as Queue

    U->>A: POST /orders
    A->>D: Insert order
    A->>Q: Enqueue fulfillment
    A->>U: 201 Created
    Q->>D: Update status

\`\`\`
```

### Guidelines

- One concept per diagram
- Max 10-15 nodes
- Use subgraphs to group related components
- Label edges when meaning isn't obvious

---

## Code Comments

### When to Comment

- **Complex algorithms** - Explain the approach
- **Workarounds** - Link to issue/ticket
- **Security-sensitive** - Explain why it's done this way
- **Regex** - Always explain regex patterns
- **Performance** - Why this optimization matters
- **Non-obvious behavior** - Side effects, edge cases

### When NOT to Comment

- Obvious code
- Repeating what TypeScript types already say
- Commented-out code (delete it)
- TODO without issue link

### Examples

```typescript
// ✅ Good - explains non-obvious behavior
/**
 * Calculates shipping cost with promotional discounts.
 * Discount applies only to orders over £50, and only
 * for UK destinations (per marketing campaign Q1-2024).
 * @throws {UnsupportedDestinationError} For non-UK addresses
 */
function calculateShipping(order: Order): Money { ... }

// ✅ Good - explains regex
// Matches UK postcodes: "SW1A 1AA", "M1 1AA", "B33 8TH"
// Format: area (1-2 letters) + district (1-2 digits) + space + sector + unit
const UK_POSTCODE = /^[A-Z]{1,2}\d{1,2}\s?\d[A-Z]{2}$/i;

// ✅ Good - links to issue for workaround
// HACK: Safari doesn't support scroll-margin with sticky headers
// See: https://github.com/example/repo/issues/123
if (isSafari) {
  element.scrollIntoView({ block: "center" });
}

// ❌ Bad - states the obvious
/** Gets user by ID */
function getUserById(id: string): User { ... }

// ❌ Bad - repeats the type
/** @param name - The user's name */
function greet(name: string) { ... }
```

## Anti-Patterns

| Don't                | Why                            | Instead                                     |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| Document everything  | Maintenance burden, goes stale | Document what's essential                   |
| Copy-paste from code | Duplicates, diverges           | Reference code, explain why                 |
| Wall of text         | Nobody reads it                | Headings, bullets, examples                 |
| Assume context       | New devs don't have it         | Explain or link to explanation              |
| Skip examples        | Theory without practice        | Show realistic, working code                |
| Generated prose      | Reads like a robot             | Write like you're explaining to a colleague |
